# Weathermend-API-app
Capstone application demonstrating the use and integration of APIs (weather & ticketmaster)

The Weathermend app allows a user to enter their location and it recommends to them nearby events based on the local weather. 
The user can than get to the Ticketmaster page for event details from those recommended events links.
